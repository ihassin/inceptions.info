# Creating an agenda

Inceptions have a duration of one to several weeks to complete, depending on variables such as:
- The current state of the product the team will work on (i.e. greenfield, new business unit, enhancements to an existing product).
- The number and quality of the systems that the product will interact with.
- The complexity of the current VSM and technical expertise of the teams developing or maintaining the product.
- The number and professional quality of the personas that will be interacting with the system.

The agenda need have only enough details to show the participants what's ahead. More often than not, the agenda and topics change based on team dynamics, so it's better to stay at a high level.

Please refer to [example configurations](/configurations), and [an example of an agenda.](example-agenda)
