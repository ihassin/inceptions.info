# Participants

The participants (and their level of participation) directly affects the success of the inception.

It is imperative to include all participating roles in deploying a product to the market.
People included in later stages may pose pertinent questions, or raise issues that could have been discussed and resolved with everyone present.

The more aspects of the product you have, the more early consensus you will have. Unfortunately, the larger the group, the harder it is to book everyone becomes.
This leads to a trade-off of the number of people, sessions and timeline, based on the situation.

The invitee list should be the result of a collaboration between your team and its sponsor. Additional input will come from the stakeholder map.

The sponsor will naturally invite all those who they want to lead in the engagement's efforts. They will most likely not invite those with whom they have strained relationships or pose a political problem. It's your duty to solve this challenge by identifying those people, roles, functions and making sure that they are well informed about the exercise, and invite them to breakout sessions, in the least.
Yet here be dragons. It's vital that everyone associated with the organizations and systems interfacing with the project be present at some stage during the inception.
