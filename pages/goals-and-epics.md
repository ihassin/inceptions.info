# Goals and Epics

## Outcome
This is an activity that helps the participants understand and visualize the new path to production after local optimization.

## Audience
This is a group-wide activity

## When to use

## Activity
A facilitator walks through the current state of the VSM and builds a future state VSM for the team to strive for as they build the new product.

The services are listed in a column, along with build/buy/open-source indicators with examples.
A conversation ensues to decide which tools can be used.

## Preparation
Whiteboard, large sticky notes, and dry-erase markers.

## Process
A facilitator draws the desired value stream while soliciting input from the participants based on the previous local optimizations.
New epics are written as changes are made to the existing process.
Keep the results posted visibly during the rest of the inception, as a reminder of the current and future states as we develop the product.
