# How to use this guide

This guide is presented from the point of view of a dispassionate facilitator, whose goal is to steer the participants
to a common understanding of what and how the product can be developed.

Initially, facilitation addresses two audiences: stakeholders and the product development team, with the primary goal to merge those two outlooks in to a single product team.
 
Therefore, the facilitator will surface business and technical goals and challenges throughout the sessions.

This guide details how to set up an agenda, select the sessions and workshops to employ and, finally, present their findings.

Whether this is the first time you're running an inception, or have already done so, please read the guide in its entirety, to allow you to make an informed selection of the sessions and establish an agenda that suites your context.

Happy learning, and good luck with your facilitation!
