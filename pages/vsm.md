# Value Stream Mapping

## Outcome

This is a session that will yield the current and future product development steps needed to put features in production, or "concept-to-cash".

Its main utility is to:
- Expose debt at risk / increase the realization of unrealized value
- Understand how the organization manages change
- Highlight system constraints
- Provide a measurable basis for optimization
- Use rational, value-based information for organizational change

## Audience

All stakeholders, and all members of the product and support teams. 
Typically needed roles:

- Application owner
- Business, Product manager/owner
- Project manager
- Application architect
- Platform architect
- Development lead
- QA lead
- SEO & Social Media Rep
- UX lead
- Infrastructure lead
- Ops lead
- Compliance lead
- Security lead
- Performance lead
- Deployment lead
- CAB rep
- L1, L2, L3 Support


## When to use
Use this prior to any planning and commitment sessions, as it will inform the teams about the effort needed to put features into production.

## Activity
Participants describe the steps needed to conceive, and deploy a feature to satisfy a customer's request.

## Preparation

- Book a room large enough to hold all the participants.
- Make sure that the room has enough wall-space to visualize the VSM with cards.
- If you have never seen the room before, ask the sponsor to send photos so you can plan placement.
- Make sure A/V can show both the participants and a shared screen if you will have people calling in remotely.
- Agree on ground rules.
- Establish an agenda that takes people’s obligations into account.
- Repeat the Prime Directive to ensure that people feel safe.
- To facilitate flow, defer collecting details through breakout sessions as needed.
- On average, a thorough VSM session takes between one and three days, depending on people’s availability and system breath.

Example of an agenda:

- Day 1:
Morning: Kickoff, Prime Directive, Retro, Hopes-and-Fears,start Current–state VSM
Afternoon: Continued

- Days 2 & 3:
Mornings: Org/Tech deep-dive & Future-state VSM
Afternoons: Continued 

- Day 3: Retro & next steps.


## Process

Select which process to map.
Define the extent of the process to be covered. Optimally, it would be “concept to cash” to see the end-to-end flow of work.

- Decide on the bounds of the map.
- Discuss and document the process steps.
- Document measurements.
- Reflect on optimization for the future state.
- Document the future state.
- Create actionable steps to implement the future state.
- Repeat in a few months and incorporate learning.

Measurements:

- Wait (wt): The time it takes from submission of a request till work starts.
- Value added (v): The effort time it takes to fulfill a request.
- Unneeded non value-add (u): The time spent on irrelevant tasks.
- Needed non value-add (n): The time spent on compliance tasks.
- %FPCA (p): The rate at which incoming requests are deemed sufficiently correct for work to begin.
- Lead time (l): The time it takes to fulfill a request (wt+v).
- Waste (w): Time not spent on value-adding tasks (l - v).
- Efficiency (e): Value added time as ratio of elapsed time and lead time (v/w).
- True Efficiency (te): FPCA factored in (v/p)

## Group size

Everyone, physically present.

## Timing

Depending on the size of the effort, the number of components and the width of the goal-posts, this may take between 2 and 4 days.

## Notes
Find a balance:
- Selecting a limited scope may lead to misinformed local optimization.
- Selecting a large scope will be rewarding, but logistically challenging.
