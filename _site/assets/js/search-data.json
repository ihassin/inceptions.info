    "content": "‘Inception’, ‘Discovery’, ‘Rapid Analysis’ - these are all concepts that describe an effort that strives to accelerate a holistic understanding of the reasoning, scope and development tactics to employ in product development. The sessions and their associated activities that ‘Inceptions’ are composed of serve two main purposes: Firstly, serving the development team in learning the context of the product, and secondly for the wider organization in learning how to support and pace its development. Underlying this, is the goal of reducing lead time from ‘Concept to cash’, to ensure low value at risk, and fast feedback to the organization from the marketplace. As the name implies, Inceptions are analysis sessions held at the beginning of development efforts. They comprise of a set of accelerated learning workshops, and result in: . | A common understanding across the team (business and implementation participants alike) and a commitment to the goals and scope of the engagement. | A set of one or more deliverables, including a release plan, the epics, features and stories they contain, and a set of visual tools that describe the customer’s journey as they use the product. | Communication and documentation plans for the product’s stakeholders. | A shared understanding across the team (business and implementation participants alike) and commitment to the goals and scope of the engagement. | Crystallize the project’s objectives. | Current and aspired Value Stream Mapping documents (VSM) that holistically describe the underlying processes by which a customer request is satisfied. | A set of one or more MVPs as the deliverables of the engagement, including a release plan, the epics, features and stories they contain and a set of visual tools that describe the customer’s journey as they use the product. | Exploration of technical and operational boundaries. | Planning a product road map. | Developing relationships and form the cross-functional product delivery team. | Technical implementation architecture and development tools, including a CI/CD production pipeline | Staffing, budget and timeline requirements for the first MVP. | Communication and documentation plans for the product’s stakeholders. | .

From experience, some companies prefer to have breakout sessions rather than have everyone participating simultaneously. In the case, it’s advisable to denote the business unit needed for different discussions in the agenda itself. For example: UX, Tech, Business. This will lead to more effort in synthesis and presentation, to make sure that everyone is heard, despite not being able to participate in all sessions. The agenda need have only enough details to show the participants what’s ahead. More often than not, the agenda and topics change based on team dynamics, so it’s better to stay at a high level. ",

The invitee list should be the result of a collaboration between your team and its sponsor. Additional input will come from the stakeholder map. The sponsor will naturally invite all those who they want to lead in the engagement’s efforts. They will most likely not invite those with whom they have strained relationships or pose a political problem. It’s your duty to solve this challenge by identifying those people, roles, functions and making sure that they are well informed about the exercise, and invite them to breakout sessions, in the least. Yet here be dragons. It’s vital that everyone associated with the organizations and systems interfacing with the project be present at some stage during the inception. ",

    "content": "This guide is presented from the point of view of a dispassionate facilitator, whose goal is to steer the participants to a common understanding of what and how the product can be developed. Initially, facilitation addresses two audiences: stakeholders and the product development team, with the primary goal to merge those two outlooks in to a single product team. Therefore, the facilitator will surface business and technical goals and challenges throughout the sessions. This guide details how to set up an agenda, select the sessions and workshops to employ and, finally, present their findings. Whether this is the first time you’re running an inception, or have already done so, please read the guide in its entirety, to allow you to make an informed selection of the sessions and establish an agenda that suites your context. Happy learning, and good luck with your facilitation! . ",
